# AGENT DESIGN COMPLIANCE

Any AI agent working on this project MUST follow these rules:

1. **Read the Design System**: Before any UI change, read `.agent/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
2. **Stick to the Spectrum**: Only use the defined color tokens.
3. **Typography**: Do not use system fonts. Use 'Arvo' for headings/poetry and 'Lato' for body/ui.
4. **Brutalism**: Hard edges (0px radius) and thick borders are mandatory.
5. **Atmosphere**: The Grain texture and fluid spacing (`clamp`) are non-negotiable.

Failure to follow these rules will result in an inconsistent user experience for "Cromazoografías".
